# 💸 onE

**onE** is an advanced, modular AI-powered trading system designed to predict, trade, and adapt in both the **cryptocurrency** and **securities** markets. Its goal: to make as much money as possible, as fast as possible — intelligently and autonomously.

---

## 🧠 Overview

onE is built as a distributed brain, separated into specialized modules for:
- 📈 **Stocks** (onEstock)
- 🪙 **Crypto** (onEcrypto)
- 🧠 **Global strategy + capital control** (onEbrain)
- 🌐 **API access for apps** (onElink)
- 🖥️ **Command-line control** (onEcmd)

## 🔄 Execution Flow (Example)

1. `onEbrain` determines that crypto should be active.
2. `onEcryptoCore` selects the best strategy.
3. `onEcryptoVision` predicts price movement.
4. `onEcryptoPulse` checks signal confidence.
5. `onEcryptoStrike` executes the trade.
6. `onEcryptoSafe` manages risk (e.g. trailing stop).
7. `onEcryptoTrail` logs the trade.
8. `onElink` sends updates to frontend (React / iOS).

## 🧪 Modules You Can Build Next

- `onElapse/`: Backtester with real-fee simulation
- `onEvolve/`: Daily model retraining engine
- `onEcmd/cli.py`: Full CLI interface for dev control
- `onEbrain/capital.py`: Dynamically split capital between crypto/stocks

---

## 📱 Frontend Integration

- SwiftUI iOS app pulls live balances, trade logs, and prediction signals from `onElink`.
- React app displays strategy dashboard and portfolio analytics.
